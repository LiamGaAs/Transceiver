The bsim6.va code in the code directory has been modified from the original
in the following ways:

  - All parameters that are noted in the BSIM6 technical note as being
    instance parameters have had the "type" attribute set to "instance"

  - Parameters that have been noted as both instance and model in the technical
    note have been had the "type" attribute set to "instance" and the Xyce-
    specific "xyceAlsoModel" attribute set to "YES"

  - Attributes have been added to the module statements so that Xyce can use
    the model as a MOSFET more easily with less hand-editing of the ADMS
    output.
 
  - All of the uses of "ddx" have been wrapped in an `ifdef __OP_STUFF__
    --- at this time Xyce neither supports the ddx operator through its
    ADMS back-end, nor supports the ability to print these quantities.

  - Uncommmented the "DISABLE_STROBE" macro to reduce unnecessary warnings.
